COT5405 Programming Assignment 1

In this repository
The entire program is called: "Assignment 1.c"
To run, Download it, then just compile and run it in an IDE for C programming
It also runs in the command window
For example: This was done in Dev C++. Upon opening it ran the program as follows
Alternatively You can just simply run the "Assignment 1.exe" file to run the program
Also the pseudocode for the program is listed here as well as, "pseudo hw1.txt"

The way the program works is that it will prompt the user for an input N between 1 and 1000
N is the N-digit size number that will be computated in addition.

It will then prompt the user if they want to print out these computations
1 for YES, and 0 for NO
Doing so will make the program take longer.

After which it will then perform 1000 computations on randomized N-digit numbers
And perform the Addition of them

At the end it will state how long all 1000 computations took in seconds.
Then the program ends and exits
