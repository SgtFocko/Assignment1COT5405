COT5405 Programming Assignment 1

The entire program is called: Assignment 1.c
To run, just compile and run it in an IDE for C programming
It also runs in the command window
For example: This was done in Dev C++. Upon opening it ran the program as follows

The way the program works is that it will prompt the user for an input N between 1 and 1000
N is the N-digit size number that will be computated in addition.

It will then prompt the user if they want to print out these computations
1 for YES, and 0 for NO
Doing so will make the program take longer.

After which it will then perform 1000 computations on randomized N-digit numbers
And perform the Addition of them

At the end it will state how long all 1000 computations took in seconds.
Then the program ends and exits
